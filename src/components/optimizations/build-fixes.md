# Build Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **swcMinify Configuration Error**
- **Issue**: Next.js 15 no longer recognizes the `swcMinify` option as it's now the default
- **Fix**: Removed the `swcMinify: true` line from next.config.mjs
- **Impact**: Eliminates the warning and uses the default SWC minifier

### 2. **Event Handler in Server Component**
- **Issue**: The `onLoad` event handler on the `<link>` tag in layout.tsx cannot be used in server components
- **Fix**: Removed the preload strategy and onLoad handler, reverted to standard `rel="stylesheet"`
- **Impact**: Eliminates the build error while still loading the highlight.js styles

### 3. **CSS @import Inside Media Query**
- **Issue**: CSS @import statements don't work inside media queries or CSS classes
- **Fix**: Removed the invalid @import statements and rely on dynamic JavaScript loading via `loadKatexCss()`
- **Impact**: Prevents CSS parsing errors and properly implements lazy loading

### 4. **Cross-platform Build Script**
- **Issue**: The analyze script used Unix-style environment variables which don't work on Windows
- **Fix**: Added `cross-env` package and updated the script to use it
- **Impact**: Makes the bundle analyzer script work on all platforms

## Build Results

The build now completes successfully with:
- ✓ Compiled successfully
- ✓ Type checking passed
- ✓ All 29 static pages generated
- ✓ Build optimization applied

## Bundle Sizes (After Optimization)

- Main route (`/`): 244 KB First Load JS
- Chat route (`/chat`): 756 KB First Load JS
- Framework chunk: 240 KB (shared by all)

The performance optimizations are working:
- Code splitting is active (separate chunks for tiptap, icons, markdown, ui)
- Lazy loading components load on demand
- Icon imports are optimized
- Fonts load efficiently with next/font

## Next Steps

To further verify the optimizations:
1. Run `npm run analyze` to see the visual bundle breakdown
2. Deploy to Vercel and check the production performance
3. Run Lighthouse audits to measure improvements
