# CORS Settings for Backend Developer

Hello, please update the CORS settings on the backend to include both development and production domains.

## Current CORS Configuration

The backend is currently configured to accept requests from:
- http://localhost:4200 ✅ (working)

However, it does not include Access-Control-Allow-Origin for the production domain:
- https://nextjs-tutor-app-589q675ya-mmalakhov777s-projects.vercel.app ❌ (not working)

## Required CORS Headers

Please add the following origins to your CORS configuration:

```python
# Example for Flask
CORS(app, origins=[
    "http://localhost:4200",
    "https://nextjs-tutor-app-589q675ya-mmalakhov777s-projects.vercel.app"
], supports_credentials=True)
```

## Required Headers
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://nextjs-tutor-app-589q675ya-mmalakhov777s-projects.vercel.app
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
- Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
- Vary: Origin

## Testing

Once updated, you can verify the CORS configuration is working with this command:
```
curl -v -H "Origin: https://nextjs-tutor-app-589q675ya-mmalakhov777s-projects.vercel.app" https://mellow-person-production.up.railway.app/api/status
```

The response should include:
```
access-control-allow-origin: https://nextjs-tutor-app-589q675ya-mmalakhov777s-projects.vercel.app
access-control-allow-credentials: true
```

Thank you!
